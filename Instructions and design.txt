STEPS TO RUN THE SCRIPT

1. To run the script you just have to paste the test images directly into the input folder, multiple images can be pasted.
2. The results are saved in the output folder in a directory with the timestamp of the execution to reduce any confusions while making any changes or testing.
3. Once the execution is completed the TOTAL NUMBER OF FIGURES DETECTED is diplayed at the TERMINAL.
4. And the result images are saved in the output/yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss/ folder.


DESIGN of the CODE:
1. The utils.py contains 2 classes named as Detect and LoadDataset.
2. Class Detect contains all the code components responsible for the image operations, which are as follows:
	a. when the class is initiated, it requires the Image path of the image for further steps.
	b. The code loads the image in BGR as well as Grayscale format.
	c. detect_contours method draws the figures which are identified in the image.
	d. detect_corner detects all corner points which the code can identify.
	e. show_edge_length draws the distance for all the edges of the figures using the 2D distance formula
	f. to get the final results, use the get_results method to get the final result image along with the number of FIGURES detected.

3. Class LoadDataset handles the file operations of the script, from loading the images, to saving the images, as well as creating the directory for saving the images.
